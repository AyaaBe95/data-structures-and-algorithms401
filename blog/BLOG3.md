# Quick Sort

## problem domain:
- write a function for quick sort, which takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using a quick sort algorithm.
- QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer  algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

## Algorithm:
- dividing the array by choosing element in the subarray(pivot) .
- arranging the array , left side is smaller and right side is greater than the pivot.
- conquers by recursively sorting the sub arrays.

## Pseudocode:

## Big-O:
- Time:O(n log n)
- Space:O(n )
