# HashTable

## Problem Domian:
- implemented a Hashtable class, which It represented by an array and nodes.

## API:
- add() Takes in a key/value pair and adds it to the Hashtable.
- contains() Takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- get() Takes  a key and returns the node containing that key. else, it returns null.
- getHash() Takes a key and returns an index 
- size() Returns the number of Nodes contained in the Hashtable.

## Big-O
- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Space Complexity O(1)
