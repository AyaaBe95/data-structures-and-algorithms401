# Challenge:

- Continuously add nodes to the queue until no further nodes are left to be added. When the node is about to be dequeued, add the children to the queue.
- Add the value to a string that will be returned after all the nodes in the tree are visited.

# Contains:
- breadthFirstTraversal() Method: using queue.
