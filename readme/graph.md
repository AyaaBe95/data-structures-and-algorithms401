# Graph

## Problem Domain:
- Implement graph data structure using class Vertex and class Edge.

## Contain:
- addNode() Takes in a Node and adds it to the Graph.
- addEdge() Takes in two Nodes that will become neighbors, and the integer representing the weight of the edge between them.
- getNodes() Returns a HashSet of all Nodes inside of a Graph.
- getNeighbors() Returns a list of all neighboring Nodes of an input Node.
- size() Returns the number of Nodes contained in the Graph.

## Big-O:
- All methods take:
1. Time: O(n)
2. Space O(n)
