# Challenge
Create stacks and queues that can insert new nodes via enqueue or push, remove nodes via pop or dequeue, and peak top/front values

# Approach & Efficiency
Create methods per docs then the Stacks and Queues in constructor. Then created the Node class with it's constructor. Fleshed out the pop, push, enqueue, dequeue, and peek methods.
Finally wrote test to check the push, pop, enqueue, dequeue and peek methods

# Solution
