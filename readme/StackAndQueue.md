# Challenge
- Create stacks and queues that can insert new nodes via enqueue or push, remove nodes via pop or dequeue, and peak top/front values

# Approach & Efficiency
* SPACE + TIME
- isEmpty() O(1)
- push() O(1)
- POP() O(1)
- enqueue() O(1)
- dequeue() O(1)
- peek() O(1)

# API (Stack)
-  isEmpty() function to check if stack is empty or not
-  push() function that take an value as input then insert it on top of stack
-  pop() function that delete the node on the top and return the oldest value of top
-  peek() function that print the value in the top of stack

# API (Queue)
 - isEmpty() function to check if Queue is empty or not
 - enqueue() function that take an value as input then insert it on rear if not empty,else will add to the front of Queue
 - dequeue() function that delete the node on the front of the queue and return the value that was in the front
 - peek() function that print the value of front
