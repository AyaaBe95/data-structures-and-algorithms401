## Problem domain:

- In this challenge I wrote a method called depthFirst() which takes in a graph and a starting node, and returns a list of nodes in depth first (pre-order) traversal.

## Methods and Big-O
depthFirst():
- Returns a List of Node objects in order of the depth first, pre-order traversal of the input graph.
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)
