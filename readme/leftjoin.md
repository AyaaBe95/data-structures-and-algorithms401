# Left Join


## Challenge
- Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
- The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
- The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values

## Approach & Efficiency
- Big (O):
1. Time:O(n)
2. Space O(n)
- It takes two HashMaps, and will return a HashMap.
